  'In a large bowl, mix all the ingredients except for the salt until thoroughly incorporated. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 20 minutes.',

  'Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise until it has grown in size by about 50%. This will take about 1-2 hours. During this time, come back every 20 minutes to perform a set of stretch-and-folds (perform up to 4 sets). If the dough hasnâ€™t grown by 50% after the 4th set, let it rest at room temperature until it has.',
  'Transfer the dough to the refrigerator to rest for 1-4 days (2 or 3 days is ideal).',

  "Partially top the dough, starting with a layer of pepperoni (if using), followed by a very light layer of cheese, being careful not to put too much cheese near the edges. Bake for 7-8 minutes at your oven's highest temperature.",
  "Remove the pizza from the oven, and finish topping it by placing the rest of the cheese, focusing on the edges, followed by the sauce in a 'racing stripe' pattern, and any additional toppings you want to use.",
  'Finish baking the pizza at the highest temperature for another 4-5 minutes until the cheese at the edges is browned to your liking.',
